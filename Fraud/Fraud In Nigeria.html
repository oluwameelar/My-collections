     <h1>Fraud in Nigeria: The Way Forward</h1>
    <br>
       <p><em><strong>FRAUD</strong></em> is a broad legal term referring to  dishonest acts that intentionally use deception to illegally deprive another
       person or entity of  money, property or legal rights.  Although fraud  in Nigeria was said to have begun around the years 1983 to 1985, fraud had been
       existing through swindlers and money-doublers.  The term <strong>'money-doublers'</strong> first appeared in a Nigerian newspaper in 1970.A money doubler
       is a confident trickster who claims to be able to double a person's money.  Such individuals claimed to have had supernatural power,  which enabled them
       to double the money.  Many unsuspecting people looking to make more money lost their own hard earned money through this scheme.</p>
    <br>
       <p>Later on, what is known as the <strong>'Nigerian Prince'</strong> scam began.  Hundreds of letters reached British mailbox,about a
       <em>Nigerian Prince</em> who needed money to reclaim his lost fortune.  Donors,the letter stated,would be handsomely rewarded.  Many people fell victim to
       this scheme.</p>
    <br>
       <p>Fraud in Nigeria is also known as<em>'419'</em>, named after the section 419 of the Nigerian criminal code which states the penalties for and deals
       with advance fee fraud.<em>FRAUDSTERS</em>,however,are known as <strong>YAHOO</strong>  boys.  This  name was coined from the popular search
       engine/e-mail,<em>Yahoo!</em>,after it was used by several scammers to conduct a much larger of the <strong>'Nigerian Prince'</strong>  scam. </p>
    <br>
       <p>From money doubling to letters to E-Mails,as the times changed,so did the method of scammers.  Today,the most common form of fraud is
       <strong>'CYBER CRIME'</strong>.Cyber crime,popularly known as <em>'Yahoo'</em>,is any crime done on the internet or with the computer.  Hardly anyone
       carries cash around,&amp; practically everything is paid for online,so fraudsters find ways to get the account details of an individual,such as his
       card number or password,or even intercept payments online.</p>

    <h2 style="color: aqua; background-color:indigo; font-family:Monotype Corsiva; text-transform: capitalize; font-size: 200%">what are the causes of fraud?</h2>
    <br>
       <p>The Fraud Triangle Theory,given by Cressey in 1973,states that there are three causes of fraud:<ol type="i"> <li><span>Perceived Pressure</span></li>
       <li><span>Rationalization</span></li> <li><span>Perceived Opportunities</span></li></ol></p>
    <br>
       <p>Under <em>Perceived Pressure</em>,we have unemployment,family needs,societal pressures,the economy &amp; the likes.  Perceived Pressure deals with
       pressures that lead to the need for more money.</p>
    <br>
       <p><em>Rationalization</em> are one's thought towards fraud.  A person who thinks,'it's only #1000 out of #1 million,it doesn't count' or 'who isn't a
       fraudster?',is more likely to carry out fraud than another who doesn't.</p>
    <br>
       <p>Finally, <em>Perceived Opportunities</em>.Without the opportunity,a person who is pressurized or has rationalized fraud cannot carry it out.</p>

       <p>Fraud is a societal vice that has given the country a bad name and eaten away the roots of our moral foundation.
       It must be brought to an end,but how?</p>
    <hr>
    <h3 style="color: cyan; background-color: orange; font-family:Monotype Corsiva; text-transform: capitalize; font-size: 200%">ways to curb fraud in our country</h3>
    <br>
       <p>Firstly, societal concepts that glorify wealth above moral standards must be done away with.  Hard work should be emphasized on and appreciated, in
       order to encourage others to do so. Also there should be provision of employment opportunities by the government.  Entrepreneurship should be encouraged
       and loans should be given to youth that want to start up small businesses in order to prevent idleness.  In addition to that, there should be more
       emphasis on database security.  Use of passwords  and restrictions on database systems will prevent infiltrations and keep information safe.  Furthermore,
       harsh punishments should be meted out to convicts according to the law,in order to prevent others from going into cyber crimes and fraud in general.
       Moreover, in order to reduce the amount of people who fall victim to fraudsters, locals should be educated on how to keep their personal information,such
       as bank details,ATM pins,e.t.c,safe.  In conclusion,although many people may complain about the economy,resorting to crime is not the way out.  In order
       to fix this country,we must all stand up and do it together.<strong>SAY 'NO' to cyber crimes.</strong></p>
