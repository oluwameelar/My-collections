    <h1>The mystery of Life -- SUMMARY</h1>
    <br>
    <p>The sojourn onboard all begins with wailing and unconscious activities.
       The reason behind this is yet to be figured out. Then comes the stages
       which cannot be fathomed out. Lots of activities,designed but not planned,
       have been put in place to make the journey through it mesmerizing and
       obviously diverse for different entities. It smiles this minute and the
       next minute,it wears a frowning face. It comes more like a whip,going
       back and forth,leaving no hint of its next agenda. The best way to utilize
       its commodities is to never let a minute slide without making fruitful
       moves,innovative ideas and breakthrough plans, so as to keep sailing
       successfully on its ship. Then comes the shipwreck,rather unexpectedly,which
       signifies the end of one's sojourn in it,giving rise to the next adventurer
       to explore. Even at that,it never ends - it goes on and on.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>Life,indeed,is a <strong><em>MYSTERY</em></strong>.</p>
